# Power Source Mapper
## Project description
### What problem does your project solve?
When planning to build a large scale campus (hospital, school, datacenter, airport, etc.), a crucial factor is to know how much electricity will be needed to support the finished structure, and where that electricity is coming from. Now more than ever, decision makers need to be cognizent of the fact that new campuses need to be built in a region with easy access to renewable energy sources.

### How does it solve the problem?
The Power Source Mapper pulls and cleans the most recent powerplant data from the EIA database and displays it on a map to provide a heuristic for decision makers to visually identify the location, capacity, and the sustainability of energy sources in a given area.
